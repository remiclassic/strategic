Caribbean Citizenship by Investment programs are the fastest, most affordable path to a second passport for people who don't qualify through ancestry. Five countries compete for your investment, and each one has a specific advantage.

If you're considering spending six figures on a passport, you should know the trade-offs before you commit. Here's the framework for choosing.

## The Five Programs: What Makes Each One Different

Five Caribbean nations offer CBI: Dominica, St. Lucia, Antigua & Barbuda, St. Kitts & Nevis, and Grenada. Programs start in the low six figures and go up from there. Processing ranges from a few months to half a year.

Rather than listing every number (which changes as governments adjust their programs), here's what actually differentiates them:

**The budget play.** Two programs compete for the title of "cheapest legitimate CBI." Both start around $100K for a single applicant, offer similar travel access to 140+ countries, and process in 3-4 months. If price is your primary constraint, this tier is where to look.

**The credibility play.** One program has been running since 1984, longer than any other CBI. That track record means wider acceptance, stronger passport recognition, and the best travel access of any Caribbean CBI (155+ countries). The premium is meaningful, roughly double the budget options, but for some applicants the reputation is worth it.

**The strategic play.** One program has something no other Caribbean CBI offers: a treaty with the United States that allows citizens to apply for E-2 investor visas. If US access matters to you, there's only one choice worth considering. The cost sits between the budget and premium tiers.

**The family play.** One program offers particularly competitive family pricing and has been running promotional rates. It also requires a short physical visit within the first five years, which some see as a positive.

The exact costs, family pricing tiers, real estate alternatives, and how each program compares on travel access, processing speed, and due diligence requirements are the kind of details that fill a book chapter, not a blog post. And they change as governments compete for applicants. The *Investment Citizenship Handbook* keeps this current.

## How to Choose

The decision framework is simpler than it looks:

**If budget is the priority:** Go with the cheapest legitimate program. A solid passport with good travel access at the lowest cost.

**If travel access matters most:** Pay the premium for the established program with the best visa-free coverage.

**If you want US access:** The E-2 treaty program is the only real option. Nothing else in the Caribbean CBI space offers this.

**If you're applying with family:** Compare family pricing across programs. The math can shift which program is cheapest when you add a spouse and children.

## Red Flags: Avoiding Scams

The CBI industry has bad actors. Watch for:

- Agents promising "guaranteed approval" (no program guarantees approval; due diligence is real)
- Prices significantly below the official government minimum (if it's too cheap, it's a scam or will have hidden fees)
- Pressure to decide immediately
- Agents who can't provide verifiable references or government authorization

Always verify your agent is licensed by the relevant government authority. The investment goes to the government, not the agent. If the agent wants you to wire money to a private account, walk away.

## The Bigger Picture

A Caribbean passport is a tool, not a destination. The real value comes from combining it with the right [tax residency](/blog/zero-tax-countries-digital-nomads), [business structure](/blog/best-countries-incorporate-online-business), and [asset protection strategy](/blog/asset-protection-101). A passport alone doesn't reduce your taxes or protect your wealth. The sovereign architecture around it does.

The complete program-by-program analysis, including application procedures, document checklists, legitimate agents, processing timelines, and strategies for combining CBI with tax-friendly residency, is inside the *Investment Citizenship Handbook*.
