Caribbean Citizenship by Investment programs are the fastest, most affordable path to a second passport for people who don't qualify through ancestry. Five countries compete for your investment, and each one has a specific advantage.

If you're considering spending six figures on a passport, you should know exactly what you're getting — and what you're not. Here's the honest comparison.

## The Five Programs at a Glance

| Country | Min. Investment | Processing | Visa-Free Countries | Special Advantage |
|---------|----------------|------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **Dominica** | $100K donation | 3-4 months | 140+ | Cheapest overall |
| **St. Lucia** | $100K donation | 3-4 months | 140+ | Competitive pricing |
| **Antigua** | $100K donation | 3-6 months | 150+ | University of West Indies option |
| **St. Kitts** | $250K donation | 3-6 months | 155+ | Oldest, most established program |
| **Grenada** | $150K donation | 4-6 months | 145+ | US E-2 treaty access |

## Dominica: The Budget Champion

**Investment:** $100K donation to the Economic Diversification Fund (single applicant). Family of four: ~$175K.

**Processing:** 3-4 months typically. Efficient government processing.

**Travel access:** 140+ countries visa-free, including EU/Schengen, UK, Singapore, Hong Kong, and most of the Americas.

**Why choose Dominica:** It's the cheapest legitimate CBI program in the world. If budget is your primary constraint and you want a solid passport with good travel access, Dominica is the default choice. The program has been running since 1993 and has a clean reputation.

**The downside:** No US visa-free access (you'll need a B1/B2 visa, though Dominicans generally get 10-year multiple-entry visas). No physical residency benefits — Dominica is a small island with limited infrastructure. This is a passport play, not a lifestyle play.

**Best for:** Budget-conscious applicants who want the most passport for the least money.

## St. Lucia: The Close Second

**Investment:** $100K donation to the National Economic Fund. Similar to Dominica in structure.

**Processing:** 3-4 months.

**Travel access:** 140+ countries. Nearly identical to Dominica.

**Why choose St. Lucia:** Marginally different travel access and occasional promotional pricing. St. Lucia has a more developed tourism infrastructure if you'd actually visit. The government has been actively improving the program's reputation and processing.

**The downside:** Essentially interchangeable with Dominica for most applicants. Slightly less track record.

**Best for:** Those choosing between the two budget options based on personal preference or minor travel access differences for their specific needs.

## Antigua & Barbuda: The Family Option

**Investment:** $100K donation to the National Development Fund (temporarily reduced from $200K). Family applications have competitive pricing.

**Processing:** 3-6 months.

**Travel access:** 150+ countries. Slightly better than Dominica, including some additional African and Asian destinations.

**Why choose Antigua:** Better travel access than the budget options. The country has a more developed economy and tourism sector. The University of the West Indies option allows a $150K contribution to the university in exchange for citizenship. Antigua also has a physical presence requirement — you must visit for 5 days within the first 5 years. Some see this as a positive (you'll actually see the country).

**The downside:** The 5-day visit requirement adds a cost (flights, accommodation). Pricing fluctuates as the government adjusts promotional rates.

**Best for:** Families wanting better travel access. Those who don't mind visiting. Applicants who want slightly more credibility than the cheapest programs.

## St. Kitts & Nevis: The Established Choice

**Investment:** $250K donation to the Sustainable Island State Contribution. Real estate option: $400K+ (can be shared between buyers in approved developments).

**Processing:** 3-6 months. Accelerated processing available for higher fees.

**Travel access:** 155+ countries. The best travel access of any Caribbean CBI passport.

**Why choose St. Kitts:** It's the original. The program has run since 1984 — longer than any other CBI. That track record matters for acceptance and credibility. St. Kitts passports are widely recognized and have the best travel access in the Caribbean CBI space. The country has invested heavily in program quality and due diligence.

**The downside:** The most expensive Caribbean option at $250K. The premium buys credibility and marginally better travel access, but whether that premium is worth $150K more than Dominica depends on your specific travel needs.

**Best for:** Those who prioritize reputation and maximum travel access. Higher-net-worth applicants for whom the cost difference is marginal. People who want the "gold standard" Caribbean passport.

## Grenada: The Strategic Choice

**Investment:** $150K donation to the National Transformation Fund. Real estate option: $220K+ in approved projects.

**Processing:** 4-6 months.

**Travel access:** 145+ countries, including China (one of few Caribbean CBI programs with this).

**Why choose Grenada:** One word: E-2. Grenada has a treaty with the United States that allows Grenadian citizens to apply for E-2 investor visas. This means a Grenadian passport is a pathway to living and working in the US — something no other Caribbean CBI offers. If US access is important to you, Grenada is the only Caribbean CBI worth considering.

**The downside:** $50K more than Dominica. The E-2 visa still requires a "substantial" investment in a US business (typically $100K+). Grenada's value is strategic — if you don't need US access, the premium over Dominica may not be justified.

**Best for:** Anyone who wants US access. Applicants from countries that don't have E-2 treaty access with the US. Strategic planners combining Caribbean citizenship with a [broader sovereignty architecture](/blog/five-flags-theory-explained).

## How to Choose

**If budget is the priority:** Dominica. $100K. Clean program. Good passport. Done.

**If travel access matters most:** St. Kitts. $250K for the best Caribbean CBI travel access.

**If you want US access:** Grenada. The E-2 treaty is unique and valuable.

**If you're applying with family:** Compare Antigua's family pricing against Dominica — sometimes Antigua wins for larger families.

## Red Flags: Avoiding Scams

The CBI industry has bad actors. Watch for:

- Agents promising "guaranteed approval" (no program guarantees approval — due diligence is real)
- Prices significantly below the official government minimum (if it's too cheap, it's a scam or will have hidden fees)
- Pressure to decide immediately
- Agents who can't provide verifiable references or aren't authorized by the government

Always verify your agent is licensed by the relevant government authority. The investment goes to the government, not the agent — if the agent wants you to wire money to a private account, walk away.
