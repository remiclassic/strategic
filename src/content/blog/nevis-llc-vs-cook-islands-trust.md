When people get serious about asset protection, two names come up more than any other: Nevis and the Cook Islands. Both have spent decades crafting laws specifically designed to frustrate creditors. Both make it extraordinarily expensive and difficult for anyone to reach your assets through legal action.

But they're not the same. Different costs, different structures, different strengths. Here's the comparison.

## Nevis LLC: The Practical Choice

**What it is:** A Limited Liability Company formed under Nevis (part of St. Kitts and Nevis) LLC Ordinance. Nevis has some of the strongest LLC protection laws in the world.

**Why it's powerful:**

**No recognition of foreign judgments.** A US court judgment has no force in Nevis. A creditor with a US judgment would need to re-litigate their case in Nevis, under Nevis law, posting a $25,000+ bond just to file. Most creditors won't bother.

**Charging order is the only remedy.** Even in a successful attack, the most a creditor can get is a "charging order" — a lien on distributions. They can't seize LLC assets, force a sale, or replace the manager. They wait for distributions that may never come.

**Short statute of limitations.** Creditors have a limited window to challenge asset transfers (typically 1-2 years from the transfer date). After that, the transfer is bulletproof.

**No public registry of members.** Privacy is built in. Your name doesn't appear in any public database.

**Setup cost:** $2,000-$5,000 including legal fees and registered agent.

**Annual cost:** $1,000-$2,000 for registered agent and government fees.

**Best for:** The operational layer of asset protection. Holding bank accounts, investments, or other assets within a structure that's expensive to attack. Works well combined with other jurisdictions.

## Cook Islands Trust: The Gold Standard

**What it is:** An asset protection trust formed under Cook Islands International Trusts Act. This is widely considered the strongest asset protection trust law in the world.

**Why it's powerful:**

**No recognition of foreign judgments.** Same as Nevis — a judgment from your home country has zero legal force. Creditors must sue in the Cook Islands, under Cook Islands law, in Cook Islands courts. This is a massive deterrent.

**Burden of proof on the creditor.** In most jurisdictions, you have to prove you didn't transfer assets fraudulently. In the Cook Islands, the creditor must prove — beyond reasonable doubt (the criminal standard, not the civil one) — that the trust was established specifically to defraud them. This is nearly impossible to meet.

**Two-year statute of limitations.** If a creditor doesn't bring a claim within two years of the asset transfer, the transfer is irrevocable. Period.

**Mandatory dismissal.** If the creditor doesn't post a bond and pursue the case within a strict timeline, the case is automatically dismissed.

**Duress provisions.** If a court in your home country orders you to repatriate trust assets, the Cook Islands trustee is legally prohibited from complying — because the order constitutes "duress" under Cook Islands law. This is the nuclear option of asset protection.

**Setup cost:** $15,000-$30,000+ including legal fees, trustee fees, and structuring.

**Annual cost:** $2,500-$5,000+ for trustee fees and administration.

**Best for:** Significant wealth ($500K+) that justifies the setup and maintenance cost. The strongest possible protection against litigation, divorce, and political risk.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Factor | Nevis LLC | Cook Islands Trust |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Setup cost** | $2K-$5K | $15K-$30K+ |
| **Annual cost** | $1K-$2K | $2.5K-$5K+ |
| **Foreign judgment recognition** | No | No |
| **Burden of proof** | On creditor (civil standard) | On creditor (criminal standard — harder) |
| **Statute of limitations** | 1-2 years | 2 years |
| **Duress protection** | Limited | Yes (trustee can't comply with foreign court orders) |
| **Privacy** | High (no public registry) | High |
| **Complexity** | Moderate | High (requires trustee relationship) |
| **Best for** | $100K-$500K in assets | $500K+ in assets |
| **Structure type** | LLC (you manage) | Trust (third-party trustee manages) |

## The Key Difference: Control vs. Protection

With a Nevis LLC, you're the manager. You control the assets directly. This is simpler and cheaper — but it means a court could theoretically order you to move assets (though Nevis won't enforce that order).

With a Cook Islands Trust, a third-party trustee controls the assets. You're a beneficiary, not the controller. This separation is what makes the duress provision work — even if a court orders you to return the assets, you can't, because you don't control them. The trustee is in the Cook Islands, bound by Cook Islands law, and legally cannot comply with foreign orders.

This distinction matters most when facing aggressive creditors or jurisdictions with strong enforcement. If someone could drag you into court and demand you "bring the money back," the Cook Islands Trust structure means you genuinely can't — it's not just that you won't.

## The Layering Strategy: Use Both

The strongest asset protection strategies don't choose one — they layer both into a multi-jurisdictional structure.

**Example:** A Cook Islands Trust holds a Nevis LLC. The LLC holds a [bank account in Singapore](/blog/offshore-banking-for-beginners). A creditor in the US gets a judgment. To reach the assets, they must: pierce a Cook Islands Trust (near impossible), then penetrate a Nevis LLC (expensive and slow), then access a Singapore bank account (another jurisdiction entirely). Each layer adds cost, time, and legal complexity that makes the attack economically irrational.

This layering approach is what makes professional asset protection work. Not one tool — a system of tools across multiple jurisdictions, each reinforcing the others.

## When to Set This Up

The universal rule: asset protection must be established before you need it. Transferring assets to an offshore structure after you're sued — or after a judgment is entered — is a fraudulent transfer. Courts can and will reverse it.

Set up your structure while the waters are calm. Before litigation. Before divorce proceedings. Before political instability. The best time is when you don't need it yet. The worst time is when you do.
