A second passport can cost $100,000. Or it can cost $500. The difference isn't your budget. It's your family tree.

Citizenship by Investment (CBI) — paying a country for a passport — gets headlines. Malta, Dominica, St. Kitts, Portugal's golden visa. These programs work. They're also expensive. Six figures. Sometimes more. For some people, that's the only path. For many others, there's a cheaper one hiding in the archives: citizenship by descent.

**Jus sanguinis.** Latin for "right of blood." It means: if your ancestors were citizens of a country, you might be too. No investment. No residency requirement. Just paperwork, proof, and patience.

## Why a Second Passport Matters

**Travel freedom.** Visa-free access varies wildly by passport. A US or UK passport opens most doors. Plenty of passports don't. Add an EU passport to the mix and you've got 180+ countries without visa hassle. A Caribbean passport can smooth entry to places that scrutinize US citizens. It's not about hiding. It's about options.

**Tax options.** Different citizenships have different tax obligations. Some countries tax worldwide income. Others don't. A second passport can open residency pathways, tax residency choices, and structures that don't exist with a single citizenship. Not evasion — planning.

**Insurance policy.** Governments change. Policies shift. Borders close. Having a second passport means you're not trapped by one country's decisions. It's the same diversification logic you use for investments. Don't put all your eggs in one nation's basket.

## The Most Generous Countries for Descent Claims

**Italy.** No generational limit. If you have an Italian ancestor — even from the 1800s — you might qualify. The catch: the Italian line must never have been broken by naturalization before the next generation was born. That sounds complicated. It is. But the payoff is EU citizenship, which means live-work rights across 27 countries. Italy is one of the most generous descent programs in the world. People have successfully claimed from great-great-grandparents.

**Ireland.** Grandparents. If you have an Irish grandparent born in Ireland, you're likely eligible. The process is straightforward — gather documents, apply through the Foreign Births Register. Cost: a few hundred euros. Time: 18–24 months currently. No residency. No language test. No investment. Just proof.

**Poland.** Similar to Italy in that there's no strict generational cutoff. Polish citizenship can pass through descendants if the ancestor was a Polish citizen at the time of the next generation's birth. The rules are nuanced — partitions, border changes, and naturalization history matter. But for those who qualify, it's EU access at a fraction of CBI cost.

**Germany.** Descent works for children of German citizens. In some cases, grandchildren can claim if the parent would have been German but for historical circumstances (e.g., loss of citizenship under Nazi rule). The rules tightened in recent years but there are still paths for those with clear German lineage.

**Hungary, Czech Republic, Greece.** Each has descent rules. Some are more generous than others. Some require language or residency. The point: Europe is full of countries that grant citizenship by blood. Your ancestry might unlock one of them.

The full genealogy research playbook — how to prove your ancestry, which documents you need, and the exact application process for each country — is in *Ancestral & Birthright Citizenship*. If descent doesn't work, *Investment Citizenship Handbook* covers every CBI program on the planet, with cost comparisons and processing times.

## Where to Start: Genealogy Research

You can't claim what you can't prove. Step one is building your family tree and identifying which ancestors might create a path.

**Birth certificates.** You need them for every generation in the line. Marriage certificates. Death certificates. Naturalization records — critical, because if an ancestor naturalized before the next in line was born, the chain can break.

**Where to look.** National archives. Church records. Immigration records (Ellis Island, etc.). FamilySearch and Ancestry.com have digitized millions of records. Hire a genealogist if you hit a wall — a few hundred dollars can save months of dead ends.

**The goal.** A clear paper trail from you back to the qualifying ancestor, with no broken links. Citizenship by descent is bureaucratic. It rewards patience and thorough documentation.

## Cost Comparison: Descent vs. Investment

**Citizenship by descent.** Application fees, document costs, translations, apostilles, maybe a lawyer or genealogist. Total: typically $500 to $5,000. Sometimes more if your case is complex. But you're not paying a government for the passport. You're paying for process.

**Citizenship by Investment.** $100,000 to $2 million-plus. Donation or real estate. Plus due diligence fees, legal fees, government fees. It's fast. It's available to anyone with the budget. But if you can get the same outcome for under $5K, why wouldn't you check first?

## What You're Not Getting Here (Yet)

You now know the concept: jus sanguinis, why it matters, which countries are generous, and how to start the genealogy research. What you don't have yet: the full country-by-country guide, exact document requirements for each nation, processing times, common rejection reasons, and the step-by-step application procedures.

That's in the books. The detailed jurisdiction breakdowns, document checklists, and how to avoid the mistakes that cost people years. Check your tree first. You might already be sitting on a six-figure asset.
