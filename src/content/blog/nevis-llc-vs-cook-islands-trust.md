When people get serious about asset protection, two names come up more than any other: Nevis and the Cook Islands. Both have spent decades crafting laws specifically designed to frustrate creditors. Both make it extraordinarily expensive and difficult for anyone to reach your assets through legal action.

But they're not the same. Different structures, different strengths, different price points. Here's the conceptual comparison.

## Nevis LLC: The Practical Choice

**What it is:** A Limited Liability Company formed under Nevis LLC Ordinance. Nevis (part of St. Kitts and Nevis) has some of the strongest LLC protection laws in the world.

**Why it's powerful:**

**No recognition of foreign judgments.** A US court judgment has no force in Nevis. A creditor would need to re-litigate their case in Nevis, under Nevis law, posting a substantial bond just to file. Most creditors won't bother.

**Charging order is the only remedy.** Even in a successful attack, the most a creditor can get is a lien on distributions. They can't seize LLC assets, force a sale, or replace the manager.

**Short statute of limitations.** Creditors have a limited window to challenge asset transfers. After that window closes, the transfer is bulletproof.

**Privacy built in.** Your name doesn't appear in any public database.

**Best for:** The operational layer of asset protection. Holding bank accounts, investments, or other assets within a structure that's expensive to attack. Accessible at a lower budget than a Cook Islands Trust.

## Cook Islands Trust: The Gold Standard

**What it is:** An asset protection trust formed under Cook Islands International Trusts Act. Widely considered the strongest asset protection trust law in the world.

**Why it's powerful:** Everything Nevis offers, plus several additional protections that make it the nuclear option of asset protection.

**Criminal burden of proof.** In most jurisdictions, you have to prove you didn't transfer assets fraudulently. In the Cook Islands, the creditor must prove, beyond reasonable doubt (the criminal standard, not the civil one), that the trust was established specifically to defraud them. This is nearly impossible to meet.

**Duress provisions.** If a court in your home country orders you to repatriate trust assets, the Cook Islands trustee is legally prohibited from complying, because the order constitutes "duress" under Cook Islands law. This is what separates Cook Islands from virtually every other jurisdiction.

**Mandatory dismissal.** If the creditor doesn't post a bond and pursue the case within a strict timeline, the case is automatically dismissed.

**Best for:** Significant wealth that justifies the higher setup and maintenance cost. The strongest possible protection against litigation, divorce, and political risk.

## The Key Difference: Control vs. Protection

This is the conceptual distinction that matters most.

With a Nevis LLC, you're the manager. You control the assets directly. Simpler and cheaper, but it means a court could theoretically order you to move assets (though Nevis won't enforce that order).

With a Cook Islands Trust, a third-party trustee controls the assets. You're a beneficiary, not the controller. This separation is what makes the duress provision work: even if a court orders you to return the assets, you genuinely can't, because you don't control them. The trustee is in the Cook Islands, bound by Cook Islands law, and legally cannot comply with foreign orders.

This distinction matters most when facing aggressive creditors or jurisdictions with strong enforcement powers.

## Why the Best Strategies Layer Both

The strongest asset protection doesn't choose one tool. It layers multiple tools across multiple jurisdictions. Each layer adds cost, time, and legal complexity for anyone trying to attack, making the effort economically irrational.

The specific layering strategies, exact costs at different budget levels, the complete jurisdiction rankings, and the step-by-step implementation plan from unprotected to fully structured are inside the *Asset Protection Playbook*.

## When to Set This Up

The universal rule: asset protection must be established before you need it. Transferring assets to an offshore structure after you're sued, or after a judgment is entered, is a fraudulent transfer. Courts can and will reverse it.

Set up your structure while the waters are calm. Before litigation. Before divorce proceedings. Before political instability. The best time is when you don't need it yet. The worst time is when you do.
