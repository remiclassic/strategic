The UAE pitch is compelling: zero personal income tax, zero corporate tax in freezones, world-class banking, and a time zone that bridges Europe and Asia. It's why thousands of digital entrepreneurs have set up companies there in the last five years.

But "set up a freezone company" is the oversimplified version. The reality involves choices between dozens of freezones, varying costs, substance requirements that didn't exist five years ago, and a banking process that tests your patience.

## What a Freezone Company Is

A freezone is a designated economic zone within the UAE that offers special business regulations. Companies registered in freezones get benefits, primarily zero corporate tax and 100% foreign ownership, in exchange for operating within the freezone's framework.

There are over 40 freezones across the UAE. Each has different rules, costs, and focus areas. Some cater to budget-conscious entrepreneurs, others to established businesses wanting premium credibility. The choice between them significantly impacts your costs and experience.

The key distinction: freezone companies can trade internationally and with other freezone entities, but trading directly with the UAE mainland market requires a local partner or a dual license. For most digital businesses selling to global clients, this restriction doesn't matter.

## The Tax Reality (Post-2023)

The UAE introduced a 9% federal corporate tax in June 2023. This changed the game, but not as dramatically as headlines suggested.

**Freezone companies** can still qualify for a 0% rate on "qualifying income," primarily income from transactions with entities outside the UAE or with other freezone entities. If your digital business serves international clients, you likely still pay 0%.

**The catch:** "Qualifying" has conditions. You need to meet substance requirements, maintain adequate resources, and derive income from qualifying activities. Pure shell companies with no real activity don't qualify anymore.

**Personal income tax:** Still zero. No tax on salary, dividends, or capital gains for individuals. This is the part that hasn't changed and likely won't.

## Costs: What to Expect

Setup costs vary dramatically depending on which freezone you choose. Budget-friendly options can start in the low single-digit thousands for the first year. Mid-tier options with more credibility and services run significantly higher. Premium financial zones can cost five figures or more.

What most people underestimate is the annual renewal. Expect to pay roughly 60-80% of your first-year cost every year after. The license, visa, and address all need annual renewal. This is the ongoing commitment that catches people off guard.

The specific freezone options, their exact costs, and which one fits your business type and budget are detailed in *Global Business Jurisdictions Guide*. These prices change regularly as freezones compete for business.

## The Setup Process (High Level)

The general flow: choose your freezone, apply for the license, obtain your UAE residency visa (which requires a physical visit for medical testing and Emirates ID), and open a bank account.

**Total timeline:** Four to eight weeks from application to fully operational, assuming banking goes smoothly.

## The Banking Headache

UAE banking is excellent once you're in. Getting in is the challenge.

Banks want to see your license, visa, proof of business activity, client contracts, bank statements from other accounts, and source of funds documentation. They'll ask about your expected transaction volumes and reject you if the numbers seem wrong for your profile.

**What works:** Having a clear, documentable business. Real clients. Real invoices. A coherent story about why you need UAE banking.

**What doesn't work:** Walking into a bank cold with a fresh license and no transaction history.

The workaround: start with fintech. Platforms like Wise Business work with UAE entities. Use them for initial operations while you build the history that traditional banks want to see.

## Substance Requirements

The days of a "brass plate" UAE company are over. To maintain your 0% freezone tax rate, you need adequate staff or outsourced resources, core income-generating activities directed from the UAE, and a physical presence (even a flexi-desk counts for most freezones).

This doesn't mean you need to live in Dubai full-time. But you need to demonstrate that the company has real operations, not just a mailbox.

## Who Should Set Up in the UAE

**High earners** where the zero personal income tax saves more than the setup and maintenance costs.

**Businesses with Middle East or Asian clients** where a Dubai entity adds credibility and simplifies payments.

**Entrepreneurs willing to maintain some UAE presence,** even if it's quarterly visits. The substance requirements are real.

**People pairing UAE residency with a [territorial or zero-tax personal strategy](/blog/zero-tax-countries-digital-nomads).** UAE residency plus a UAE company plus zero personal income tax is one of the cleanest structures available.

## Who Should Look Elsewhere

**Low-revenue businesses.** If you're in the early stages, the annual costs don't make sense. A [simpler structure](/blog/best-countries-incorporate-online-business) is more efficient until revenue justifies the overhead.

**People who won't visit.** The visa process requires at least one trip. Ongoing substance requirements mean you should plan to visit. If you never plan to set foot in the UAE, it's the wrong structure.
