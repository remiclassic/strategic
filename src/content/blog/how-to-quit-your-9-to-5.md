Everyone wants to quit their job. Almost nobody has a plan for what happens after they do.

The fantasy: launch a digital product, money rains from the sky, hand in your resignation tomorrow. The reality: it takes planning, a financial runway, and a system that generates predictable income before you cut the cord. Not because it's hard. Because doing it recklessly is how people end up back in a cubicle six months later, humbled and broke.

Here's the realistic timeline. Not the motivational poster version. The one that actually works.

## Month 1-2: Build While Employed

You don't quit first and figure it out later. You build first and quit when the numbers say you can.

Your job is your investor right now. It pays your bills while you build something that will eventually replace it. Don't resent the job. Use it.

**What to do:** Pick a product idea. Validate it by finding people who have the problem. Build a minimum viable version — a [PDF, a template, a toolkit](/blog/digital-products-you-can-create-this-weekend). Launch it on Gumroad or your own site. Get your first sale. That first sale matters more than the next hundred because it proves the concept is real.

**Target:** One product live. One sale. Proof of concept.

## Month 3-4: Optimize and Add Traffic

First sale happened. Now the question: can you make it happen repeatedly?

**What to do:** Write a sales page that actually converts. Set up basic SEO content — blog posts that target what your customers are searching for. Start an email list from buyers. Improve the product based on early feedback. Consider a second product to cross-sell.

**Target:** Consistent daily sales. $500-$1,000/month. An email list growing.

## Month 5-8: Scale the System

This is where most people are still employed — and that's fine. You're building infrastructure, not sprinting. The goal is a system that runs without you checking it hourly.

**What to do:** Add more products. Build bundles. Create automated email sequences that nurture buyers into repeat customers. Diversify traffic sources — SEO, social, communities, partnerships. [Price your products properly](/blog/how-to-price-digital-products) instead of undercharging out of fear.

**Target:** $2,000-$5,000/month consistently for 2-3 months. An email list of 500+. Multiple products selling.

## Month 9-12: The Decision Point

You're earning $3K-$5K/month from digital products. Your job pays $5K-$8K. The math is getting close. But don't quit on math alone.

**The financial runway check:** You need 6 months of living expenses saved. Not invested. Not in crypto. In a boring savings account you can access tomorrow. This is your safety net. It lets you quit without panic and gives you runway to scale without desperation.

**The consistency check:** Is the income stable or spiky? Two good months don't mean you've "made it." You need 3+ months of consistent revenue before you can trust the trend. Spiky income plus no job equals stress, and stress kills creativity.

**The growth trajectory check:** Is revenue growing, flat, or declining? Growing means your systems work and more effort will produce more results. Flat means you've hit a ceiling that needs breaking. Declining means something's wrong and quitting would make it worse.

## The Resignation

When you have:
- 6 months of expenses saved
- 3+ months of consistent digital product income
- Revenue covering at least 70% of your living costs (the gap closes fast when you have full-time focus)
- A growing email list and multiple products

Then you're ready. Not because you can't fail. Because you've built enough infrastructure that failure would take effort.

Write the letter. Give proper notice. Don't burn bridges — your former colleagues are future customers, referral sources, and safety nets.

## Month 13+: Full-Time Freedom

Now your job is growing the business. The hours you spent commuting, sitting in meetings, and pretending to look busy? Those are yours now. Channel them into content, new products, and systems.

Most people find that their income accelerates once they go full-time — not because they're working more hours, but because they're working focused hours on the thing that actually pays them.

## The Mindset Shift Nobody Talks About

Quitting a job isn't just a financial decision. It's an identity shift. You go from "person who has a job" to "person who doesn't." That sounds trivial until it happens. The structure disappears. The social circle changes. The question "what do you do?" suddenly requires a real answer.

The people who navigate this well are the ones who've already built a new identity around their product business while still employed. They're not "quitting" — they're transitioning. That's a different emotional experience.

The full framework for designing this transition — the life architecture, the energy management, the daily rhythm that replaces corporate structure with something better — is inside *Design Your Exit*. The income engine is *Don't Do Anything*. Together, they're the complete system for going from employed to free without crashing.
