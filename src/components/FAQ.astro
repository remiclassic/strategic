const faqs = [
    {
        question: "What exactly do I get?",
        answer: "You get individual PDF books, each one a separate download. The Starter package includes 2 books on building passive digital income and designing your lifestyle. The Builder package adds 4 more on sovereignty, tax strategy, residency, and global business structure. The Scale to Freedom package adds 5 more covering offshore banking, asset protection, and second passports. Every book is written to be actionable, not theoretical."
    },
    {
        question: "What format are the books in?",
        answer: "Each book is a separate PDF. You get individual files, one per book, so you can organize and read them however you like. They work on any device including your phone, tablet, laptop, or e-reader that supports PDF. You can also print them if you prefer paper."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I access the books after purchase?",
        answer: "Instantly. As soon as your payment goes through, you get download links for each book in your package. No waiting, no drip schedule, no hoops. Every PDF is yours to keep forever."
    },
    {
        question: "Is this a one-time purchase or a subscription?",
        answer: "One-time purchase. You pay once, you keep everything forever, and you get all future updates to your tier at no extra cost. There are no recurring charges, no hidden fees, and no upsells waiting around the corner."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need any prior experience?",
        answer: "No. The Starter books are written for complete beginners with zero background in online business. If you can read and follow step-by-step instructions, you have everything you need. The Builder and Scale tiers get more advanced, but you will be ready for them after finishing the Starter material."
    },
    {
        question: "How much time does this take?",
        answer: "Each book is a focused read you can finish in a few hours. Most readers work through the Starter tier in a week or two, then start implementing. This is not a 300-hour course. It is a set of concise, practical guides designed to respect your time."
    },
    {
        question: "How do I know which package to choose?",
        answer: "If you are just starting out and want to build your first online income stream, grab the Starter. If you already earn online and want to structure your business for tax efficiency, privacy, and global flexibility, go with the Builder. If you want the complete toolkit including offshore banking, asset protection, and second passports, the Scale to Freedom package covers everything."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I upgrade to a higher tier later?",
        answer: "Each package is a standalone purchase at the price you see. If you start with the Starter and want more later, you can grab a higher tier anytime. If you are on the fence, the Builder is the sweet spot for most people."
    },
    {
        question: "Is all of this legal?",
        answer: "Yes. Every strategy in these books uses existing legal frameworks for tax optimization, business structuring, and residency planning. These are the same approaches used by international entrepreneurs, expats, and legal professionals worldwide. We always recommend consulting a qualified advisor for your specific situation."
    },
    {
        question: "How is this different from free information online?",
        answer: "Free content gives you scattered pieces. These books give you a complete, ordered system. Every strategy is laid out step by step with real costs, real timelines, and real jurisdiction comparisons. No filler, no fluff, no trying to piece together contradictory blog posts from 2019. You get a single, coherent roadmap you can actually follow."
    },
    {
        question: "How long do I keep the books?",
        answer: "Forever. You get lifetime access to all materials and future updates, no strings attached."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I want a refund?",
        answer: "You have 30 days to try everything risk-free. If it is not for you, just ask and you get your money back. No forms, no justification, no awkward conversations."
