A second passport costs somewhere between $500 and $2 million. That's not a helpful range. Let's fix that.

There are exactly four ways to get a second passport: ancestry (citizenship by descent), investment (citizenship by investment), naturalization (live there long enough), and birthplace (jus soli). Each has dramatically different costs, timelines, and requirements. Here's every pathway, with real numbers.

## Pathway 1: Citizenship by Descent ($500-$5,000)

**How it works:** Prove you have ancestors from a country that grants citizenship through bloodline. Apply. Wait. Receive passport.

**Cost breakdown:**
- Genealogy research: $0-$1,000 (DIY vs. hiring a genealogist)
- Document gathering (birth/marriage/death certificates): $200-$1,000
- Translations and apostilles: $100-$500
- Application fees: $100-$500
- Legal assistance (optional): $500-$2,000

**Total: $500-$5,000** for most cases. Complex cases with difficult genealogy can run higher.

**Timeline:** 6 months to 5 years. Italy is notoriously slow (2-5 years). Ireland is faster (12-18 months). Poland varies.

**Best countries:** [Italy](/blog/second-passport-through-ancestry) (no generational limit), Ireland (grandparent), Poland (no cutoff), Hungary, Germany, Portugal, Spain, Lithuania.

**The catch:** You need a provable, unbroken chain. If your ancestor naturalized in another country before their child was born, the chain may break. Documentation from 1800s-era Europe isn't always available. Patience is required.

**Verdict:** By far the cheapest option. Check your family tree before considering anything else. A few hundred dollars in genealogy research could save you $100K+.

## Pathway 2: Citizenship by Investment ($100K-$2M+)

**How it works:** Pay a government — through a donation, real estate purchase, or economic contribution — in exchange for citizenship. Legal, regulated programs with due diligence.

**Cost breakdown by country:**

**Budget tier ($100K-$200K):**
- **Dominica:** $100K donation (single applicant). Fast. No travel requirement. Passport covers 140+ countries. The cheapest legitimate CBI program.
- **St. Lucia:** $100K donation. Similar to Dominica. Slightly less travel access.
- **Antigua & Barbuda:** $100K donation (temporarily reduced). Requires 5-day visit within 5 years.
- **Vanuatu:** ~$130K all-in. Fastest processing: 1-2 months to passport.

**Mid tier ($200K-$400K):**
- **Grenada:** $150K donation + fees. The special advantage: Grenada has an E-2 treaty with the US, making it a pathway to US residency for non-US persons. This alone makes it worth the premium over Dominica.
- **St. Kitts & Nevis:** $250K donation. The original CBI program. Strong reputation.
- **Turkey:** $400K real estate purchase. Unique: gives access to the US E-2 treaty. Large country with a real economy. Property can be sold after 3 years.

**Premium tier ($500K+):**
- **Malta:** €690K+ donation + real estate (rent or buy) + €10K philanthropic contribution. Total: €1M+. The payoff: EU citizenship. Live and work anywhere in the EU. 180+ country visa-free access. The most valuable CBI passport available.
- **Austria:** €3M-€10M+ (economic contribution). Ultra-premium. EU passport. Very few applicants approved per year.

**Timeline:** 2 months (Vanuatu) to 14 months (Malta). Most Caribbean programs: 3-6 months.

**The catch:** Due diligence is real. Criminal records, fraud, sanctions violations — anything sketchy and you're rejected. Reputable programs protect their reputation.

## Pathway 3: Naturalization (Low Cost, High Time)

**How it works:** Live in a country legally for a specified number of years. Apply for citizenship. Most countries require 5-10 years of legal residency plus language skills and integration.

**Cost breakdown:**
- Residency visa/permit: Varies ($0-$5,000/year)
- Living expenses: Years of your life in that country
- Language courses: $500-$2,000
- Application fee: $100-$1,000
- Total direct cost: Low. Opportunity cost: high.

**Fastest naturalization countries:**
- **Argentina:** 2 years of residency
- **Peru:** 2 years
- **Dominican Republic:** 2 years
- **Paraguay:** 3 years
- **Brazil:** 4 years (1 year if married to a Brazilian)
- **Israel:** Immediate for those of Jewish descent (Law of Return)

**Standard timelines:**
- Most EU countries: 5-10 years
- US: 5 years (3 if married to a US citizen)
- Canada: 3 years of physical presence out of 5

**The catch:** You actually have to live there. Physical presence requirements are real — typically 50-80% of the qualifying period. This isn't a paper exercise like some residency programs.

**Verdict:** The cheapest in cash terms. The most expensive in time. Best for people who genuinely want to live in the country anyway.

## Pathway 4: Birthplace/Jus Soli (Free-$0)

**How it works:** You were born in a country that grants citizenship by birthplace. You might already be a citizen.

**Countries with unrestricted jus soli:** US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, most of the Americas.

**Countries with conditional jus soli:** UK, France, Australia, Germany — usually requires a parent to have been a legal resident.

**Cost:** $0 beyond application fees if you qualify. If you were born in one of these countries, check whether you're already a citizen.

**The catch:** Most people already know if this applies to them. But sometimes it's overlooked — children of diplomats, people born during transit, or people who moved away as infants. Worth checking.

## The Decision Matrix

| Your budget | Best pathway | Timeline |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| $0-$5K | Ancestry (check your tree) | 6 months - 5 years |
| $100K-$200K | Caribbean CBI (Dominica, St. Lucia) | 3-6 months |
| $150K-$250K | Grenada or St. Kitts (better travel access) | 3-6 months |
| $400K+ | Turkey (real estate + E-2 treaty) | 3-6 months |
| $1M+ | Malta (EU citizenship) | 12-14 months |
| Time rich, cash poor | Naturalization (Argentina, Paraguay) | 2-4 years |

## Always Check Ancestry First

Before spending $100K+ on a CBI program, spend $500 on genealogy research. You might be sitting on an EU passport through an Italian great-grandparent or an Irish grandparent.
