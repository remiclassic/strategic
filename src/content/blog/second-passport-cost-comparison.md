A second passport costs somewhere between $500 and $2 million. That's not a helpful range. Let's narrow it down.

There are exactly four ways to get a second passport: ancestry (citizenship by descent), investment (citizenship by investment), naturalization (live there long enough), and birthplace (jus soli). Each has dramatically different costs, timelines, and requirements.

## Pathway 1: Citizenship by Descent ($500-$5,000)

**How it works:** Prove you have ancestors from a country that grants citizenship through bloodline. Apply. Wait. Receive passport.

The costs are modest: genealogy research, document gathering (birth, marriage, and death certificates going back generations), translations and apostilles, application fees, and sometimes legal assistance. Most cases land between $500 and $5,000. Complex cases with difficult genealogy can run higher.

**Timeline:** Six months to five years, depending on the country. Some are notoriously slow. Others process within a year.

**The catch:** You need a provable, unbroken chain. If your ancestor naturalized in another country before their child was born, the chain may break. Documentation from the 1800s isn't always available. Patience is required.

**Verdict:** By far the cheapest option. Check your family tree before considering anything else. A few hundred dollars in genealogy research could save you six figures. The [full ancestry citizenship guide](/blog/second-passport-through-ancestry) covers which countries are most generous and how to start the research.

## Pathway 2: Citizenship by Investment ($100K-$2M+)

**How it works:** Pay a government, through a donation, real estate purchase, or economic contribution, in exchange for citizenship. Legal, regulated programs with due diligence.

Programs fall into three broad tiers:

**Budget tier ($100K-$200K).** Several Caribbean nations offer programs at this level. You get a solid passport with good travel access (140-150+ countries visa-free), fast processing (a few months), and no residency requirements. This is the most accessible entry point for CBI.

**Mid tier ($200K-$500K).** Higher investment buys better travel access, specific treaty benefits (like US E-2 access through certain programs), or real estate in a desirable location. Some programs at this level offer unique strategic advantages worth the premium.

**Premium tier ($500K+).** European programs at the top end offer EU citizenship, which means live-and-work rights across 27 countries and 180+ country visa-free access. These are the most valuable CBI passports available, but the cost reflects it. Some ultra-premium programs run into the millions.

**Timeline:** As fast as one to two months for the fastest programs, up to 14 months for premium European routes. Most Caribbean programs process in three to six months.

**The catch:** Due diligence is real. Criminal records, fraud, sanctions violations: anything sketchy and you're rejected. Reputable programs protect their reputation.

The specific programs, their exact current pricing, and how they compare on every dimension are inside the *Investment Citizenship Handbook*.

## Pathway 3: Naturalization (Low Cost, High Time)

**How it works:** Live in a country legally for a specified number of years. Apply for citizenship. Most countries require 5-10 years of legal residency plus language skills and integration.

Direct costs are low: residency visa fees, language courses, and an application fee. The real cost is time. You need to actually live there, typically spending 50-80% of the qualifying period physically present.

Some countries naturalize faster than others. A few allow citizenship applications after just two to three years of residency. Most require five to ten. EU countries tend to be on the longer end.

**Verdict:** The cheapest in cash terms. The most expensive in time. Best for people who genuinely want to live in the country anyway.

## Pathway 4: Birthplace/Jus Soli (Free)

**How it works:** You were born in a country that grants citizenship by birthplace. You might already be a citizen.

Most of the Americas (US, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and others) have unrestricted birthplace citizenship. Some countries like the UK, France, Australia, and Germany have conditional rules that usually require a parent to have been a legal resident.

**Cost:** Zero beyond application fees if you qualify. If you were born in one of these countries, check whether you're already a citizen. Sometimes it's overlooked, especially for people who moved away as infants.

## The Decision Framework

The right pathway depends on two things: your budget and your timeline.

**If you have ancestry in the right countries:** Start there. Always. It's 10-100x cheaper than investment and gives you the same passport.

**If you have six figures but not time:** CBI is the fast track. Caribbean programs give you a passport in months. The books break down exactly which program fits your profile.

**If you have time but not six figures:** Naturalization through strategic relocation. Move somewhere with a fast naturalization timeline and favorable tax treatment. Two birds, one stone.

**If you were born abroad:** Check your birthright status. It's free.
