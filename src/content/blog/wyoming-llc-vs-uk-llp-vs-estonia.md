You've decided to incorporate. Now you're drowning in options. Wyoming LLC. UK LLP. Estonian OÜ. Every blog post says a different one is "the best." None of them are wrong. They're just talking about different situations.

Here's the framework for choosing, based on what actually matters for digital entrepreneurs.

## The Three Structures at a Glance

All three are popular with location-independent entrepreneurs, but they solve different problems. The right choice depends on where your clients are, how your business earns money, and what you plan to do with the profits.

**Wyoming LLC** is a US Limited Liability Company. Tax-transparent by default: no corporate tax, income passes through to members. For non-US persons with no US-source income, the LLC can be tax-neutral at the entity level. Setup is fast and cheap. Privacy is strong (no public member disclosure). US payment processors love US entities.

**UK LLP** is a Limited Liability Partnership. Also tax-transparent: profits pass through to partners. For non-UK resident partners, UK tax generally doesn't apply to profits from non-UK activities. Setup is fast through Companies House. The UK has extensive double tax treaties. The trade-off: your name, address, and accounts are on a public register.

**Estonia OÜ** is a private limited company. A separate taxable entity with a unique feature: 0% tax on retained earnings. You only pay when profits are distributed (at about 20%). If your business reinvests heavily, this is genuinely valuable. It's an EU entity, which carries credibility with European clients.

## How They Compare on What Matters

**Setup speed and cost.** Wyoming is the fastest and cheapest to form. UK is similarly quick. Estonia takes longer and requires e-Residency first.

**Ongoing costs.** Wyoming is the cheapest to maintain (registered agent and annual report). UK is moderate (annual accounts, confirmation statement, accounting fees). Estonia is the most expensive because of mandatory monthly bookkeeping and accounting compliance. That hidden recurring cost makes Estonia significantly more expensive than its setup price suggests.

**Banking access.** Wyoming and UK entities can access their respective domestic banking systems, though non-residents face friction in both. [Estonia's banking situation](/blog/estonia-e-residency-review) is the tightest: most e-Residents use fintech platforms rather than traditional Estonian banks.

**Tax treatment.** Wyoming and UK are pass-through (you're taxed personally wherever you live). Estonia defers corporate tax until distribution. None of them eliminate your personal tax obligation in your home country.

**Privacy.** Wyoming is strongest (no public member disclosure). Estonia is moderate. UK is weakest (public register).

**Credibility.** Each one carries weight in its region. Wyoming for US clients and payment processors. UK for European and British clients. Estonia for EU credibility, especially in tech and SaaS.

## Decision Framework

**Choose Wyoming if:**
- Your clients are primarily in the US
- You value privacy
- You want the lowest ongoing cost
- You need US payment processor compatibility (Stripe, PayPal)

**Choose UK LLP if:**
- Your clients are in the EU or UK
- You want fast setup with European credibility
- You don't mind public registration
- You're a non-UK resident wanting tax transparency

**Choose Estonia if:**
- You're building a SaaS, tech, or high-reinvestment business
- You want EU entity status
- You don't need to extract profits regularly
- You're comfortable with fintech banking

**Choose none of the above if:**
- You're a high earner who'd benefit more from a [UAE freezone structure](/blog/uae-freezone-company-setup)
- You need premium banking (consider Singapore)
- You want zero-tax at every level (other jurisdictions handle this, but banking gets harder)

## The Bigger Picture

The entity structure is one flag in a [five-flag system](/blog/five-flags-theory-explained). It works best when paired with the right personal tax residency, banking structure, and asset protection strategy. A Wyoming LLC with a UAE residency works differently than a Wyoming LLC with a German residency. Context is everything.
