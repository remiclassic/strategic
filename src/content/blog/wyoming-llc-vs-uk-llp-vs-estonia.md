You've decided to incorporate. Now you're drowning in options. Wyoming LLC. UK LLP. Estonian OÜ. Every blog post says a different one is "the best." None of them are wrong — they're just talking about different situations.

Here's the side-by-side comparison nobody gives you, with real costs, real tax implications, and honest assessments of who each one is for.

## Quick Comparison Table

|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| **Setup cost** | $100-$300 | £100-£400 | €300-€600 |
| **Annual cost** | $50-$200 | £100-£500 | €1,200-$3,000+ |

| **Best for** | US clients, privacy | EU clients, credibility | Tech/SaaS, reinvestment |

## Wyoming LLC: Deep Dive

**Structure:** A Limited Liability Company that's tax-transparent by default. No corporate tax — income passes through to members and is taxed at their personal level. For non-US persons with no US-source income, the LLC can be tax-neutral at the entity level.

**Why people choose it:** Privacy. Wyoming doesn't require public disclosure of LLC members. Setup is fast and cheap. The US is a familiar, credible jurisdiction. Many payment processors (Stripe, PayPal) prefer US entities. If your clients are American or your revenue comes through US platforms, a Wyoming LLC is the path of least resistance.

**The catch for non-US persons:** You'll need an EIN (tax identification number), which requires dealing with the IRS. Banking as a non-US person requires more effort — you may need to visit the US or use a service. And while the LLC itself isn't taxed, you're still responsible for tax wherever you're personally resident.

**The catch for US persons:** Pass-through taxation means all LLC income is your personal income, taxed at your marginal rate. A Wyoming LLC doesn't save you from US taxes. It gives you liability protection and structure, not tax reduction. For tax benefits, you need to pair it with a [residency strategy](/blog/zero-tax-countries-digital-nomads).

**Annual cost:** $50-$200. Just the registered agent and annual report. The cheapest ongoing structure of the three.

## UK LLP: Deep Dive

**Structure:** A Limited Liability Partnership. Tax-transparent — profits pass through to partners and are taxed at their personal level. For non-UK resident partners, UK tax generally doesn't apply to profits from non-UK activities.

**Why people choose it:** EU and UK credibility. If you invoice European or British clients, a UK LLP looks professional and familiar. Registration is fast through Companies House. The UK has an extensive network of double tax treaties.

**The catch:** LLPs are on a public register. Your name, address, and filed accounts are publicly accessible. Privacy is minimal. You need at least two designated members — though one can be a corporate member.

**Banking has tightened.** UK banks are cautious about non-resident LLP members. You may need to use fintech (Wise Business, Mercury) rather than a traditional UK bank. This works fine for most digital businesses but limits your options for serious wealth storage.

**Accounting is more involved** than Wyoming. Annual accounts must be filed with Companies House. A confirmation statement is required annually. If you're above certain thresholds, you may need an audit. Budget £500-£2,000/year for accounting depending on complexity.

**Annual cost:** £500-£2,000+ depending on accounting needs. More than Wyoming, less than Estonia when you factor in accounting.

## Estonia OÜ: Deep Dive

**Structure:** A private limited company (Osaühing). A separate taxable entity. 0% tax on retained earnings — you only pay when profits are distributed. Distributed profits face a 20/80 tax rate (effectively ~25% on net).

**Why people choose it:** The reinvestment benefit. If your business reinvests profits — into product development, marketing, inventory — you pay zero corporate tax on those earnings. For SaaS companies, tech businesses, and any model that scales through reinvestment, this is genuinely valuable. Plus, it's an EU entity, which carries credibility with European clients and simplifies EU VAT compliance.

**The catch:** [Banking is the bottleneck](/blog/estonia-e-residency-review). Estonian banks have significantly restricted e-Residency company accounts. Most e-Residents end up using Wise Business or similar fintech platforms instead of traditional banks.

**Accounting is mandatory and ongoing.** Monthly bookkeeping, annual reports, and compliance with Estonian accounting standards. Budget €100-€200/month for an accounting firm. This is the hidden cost that makes Estonia significantly more expensive than its setup price suggests.

**The personal tax piece:** Your personal income from the company — salary, dividends — is taxed wherever you're personally a tax resident. Estonia's 0% only applies at the corporate level on retained earnings. If you need to take money out to live on, you pay.

**Annual cost:** €1,500-$3,600+ when you include mandatory accounting, registered address, and administration. The most expensive ongoing structure of the three.

## Decision Framework

**Choose Wyoming if:**
- Your clients are primarily in the US
- You value privacy (no public member disclosure)
- You want the lowest ongoing cost
- You need US payment processor compatibility

**Choose UK LLP if:**
- Your clients are in the EU/UK
- You want fast setup with EU credibility
- You don't mind public registration
- You're a non-UK resident wanting tax transparency

**Choose Estonia if:**
- You're building a SaaS, tech, or high-reinvestment business
- You want EU entity status
- You don't need to extract profits regularly
- You're comfortable with fintech banking

**Choose none of the above if:**
- You're a high earner ($100K+) who'd benefit more from a [UAE freezone structure](/blog/uae-freezone-company-setup)
- You need premium banking (consider Singapore)
- You want zero-tax at every level (consider BVI, but banking is harder)

## The Bigger Picture

The entity structure is one flag in a [five-flag system](/blog/five-flags-theory-explained). It works best when paired with the right personal tax residency, banking structure, and asset protection strategy. A Wyoming LLC with a UAE residency works differently than a Wyoming LLC with a German residency. Context is everything.
