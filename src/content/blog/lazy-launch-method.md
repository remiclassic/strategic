You've been "working on" your digital product for three months. It's still not live. You're still tweaking the layout, second-guessing the topic, and waiting until it's "ready."

It will never be ready. Not by your standards. Your standards are a procrastination tool dressed up as professionalism.

Here's the antidote: the Lazy Launch Method. Seven days. One product. Live and selling by Sunday. No perfectionism allowed.

## Day 1: Pick the Problem (Monday)

Not "brainstorm ideas for two weeks." Pick. One. Problem.

The problem should be something you've already solved for yourself. Something a friend has asked you about. Something people are Googling right now.

**The test:** Can you explain the solution in one sentence? "How to set up a freelance business in a weekend." "The complete checklist for moving abroad." "A meal planning system for people who hate cooking." If you can say it in one sentence, it's specific enough.

Don't pick something you need to research for a month. Pick something you already know. Your expertise is the asset. Today is about choosing, not perfecting.

**End of day 1:** You have a topic sentence and a rough outline of what the product will cover.

## Day 2: Outline the Product (Tuesday)

Open a document. Write every section header. Under each one, bullet point the key things you'll cover.

Think of it as explaining the solution to a friend over coffee. What would you tell them first? Second? Third? That's your outline.

**The format decision:** PDF guide? Notion template? Spreadsheet? Checklist? Pick the format that best delivers the value. If it's a process, a checklist or guide works. If it's a system, a template works. If it's knowledge, a guide works. Don't overthink this.

**End of day 2:** Complete outline with 5-8 sections and bullet points under each.

## Day 3: Write the Content (Wednesday)

This is the biggest day. Block 3-4 hours. Put on headphones. Write.

Don't edit as you go. Don't fiddle with fonts. Don't re-read what you wrote an hour ago. Just write forward. Fill in each section from your outline. Aim for 15-25 pages if it's a guide, or complete functionality if it's a template.

The secret to fast writing: talk out loud, then type what you said. Conversational writing is faster than "professional" writing and usually better anyway.

**End of day 3:** Rough draft complete. Ugly. Unformatted. Done.

## Day 4: Edit and Format (Thursday)

Now you clean it up. Read through once for clarity. Cut anything that doesn't add value. Fix obvious errors. Don't rewrite. Tighten.

Format it. If it's a PDF, use Canva or Google Docs with a clean template. Headers. White space. Maybe a cover page. It should look intentional, not fancy. Professional, not polished to death.

**End of day 4:** Final product ready to deliver.

## Day 5: Write the Sales Page (Friday)

This scares people more than writing the product. It shouldn't. A sales page has a formula:

**Headline:** State the outcome. "Launch Your Freelance Business This Weekend."

**Problem:** Describe the pain your buyer feels. Make them nod.

**Solution:** Introduce your product as the answer.

**What's inside:** Bullet points of what they'll get and learn.

**Social proof:** Testimonials if you have them. Skip if you don't; you'll add them later.

**Price + button:** State the price. Explain why it's worth it (time saved, money saved, pain avoided). Add a buy button.

That's it. One page. You can write this in two hours.

**End of day 5:** Sales page written.

## Day 6: Set Up and Go Live (Saturday)

Create your account on [your chosen platform](/blog/where-to-sell-digital-products-2026). Upload the product. Set the price. Connect your sales page. Test the purchase flow: buy your own product to make sure it works.

If you're using your own site, set up Stripe or Lemon Squeezy. If you're using Gumroad, the whole setup takes 20 minutes.

**End of day 6:** Product is live. Someone could buy it right now.

## Day 7: Tell People (Sunday)

The scariest day. But also the simplest. Share it.

Post in communities where your target audience hangs out. Share on your social channels. Email anyone you know who fits the profile. Not "buy my thing" spam. Genuine "I made this, it solves X problem, here's the link."

**End of day 7:** Real people have seen your product. Some of them might buy it today. Most won't. That's fine. The product exists. The hardest part is over.

## Why Speed Beats Perfection

A product that's live and selling at 80% quality beats a product that's "almost ready" at 100% quality and sitting in your Google Drive.

You can always improve it. Update the content. Redesign the cover. Rewrite the sales page after you see what converts. Version 2 is informed by real customer feedback. Version 1 just needs to exist.

The complete system for refining your product, building a catalog, automating your marketing, and scaling from one product to a full business. That's inside *Don't Do Anything*. But the Lazy Launch Method gets you to the starting line. Everything else is iteration.

Ship it. Learn. Improve. Repeat. That's the entire game.
