You've been thinking about this for months. Maybe years. "I should create a digital product." Then you open a blank document, stare at it for twenty minutes, and close it. Back to scrolling.

The problem isn't motivation. It's that nobody showed you what "a digital product" actually looks like. Not in theory. In practice. The kind you can build Saturday morning and have listed by Sunday night.

Here are ten. Pick one. Build it. Stop thinking and start shipping.

## 1. A Checklist

The simplest product on earth. Take a process you know — launching a podcast, setting up a home office, onboarding a freelance client — and turn it into a step-by-step checklist. Format it in Canva or Google Docs. Export as PDF. Done.

People pay for checklists because they eliminate the fear of forgetting something. That's worth $5 to $15 every time.

## 2. A Notion or Google Sheets Template

If you've built a system for yourself — a budget tracker, a content calendar, a project manager, a habit tracker — other people want it. Clean it up. Add instructions. Sell it for $9 to $29.

Templates sell because people don't want to start from scratch. They want to start from "mostly done."

## 3. A Swipe File

Collect the best examples of something: email subject lines, sales page headlines, cold outreach messages, Instagram captions. Organize them. Add notes on why each one works. Package it as a PDF.

Swipe files sell because they save hours of research and eliminate creative block. Marketers, copywriters, and business owners buy these constantly.

## 4. A Mini-Guide (10-20 Pages)

Not a book. A focused guide that answers one specific question. "How to negotiate a remote work arrangement with your employer." "How to set up a Gumroad store in 60 minutes." "A beginner's guide to meal prepping for one."

Short. Specific. Useful. Price: $7 to $19. Build time: a few hours of writing plus basic formatting.

## 5. A Printable Planner or Worksheet

Daily planners, goal-setting worksheets, meeting agenda templates, meal planning pages. Design them in Canva — there are free templates to start from. Sell as downloadable PDFs that people print at home.

The printable market on Etsy alone is enormous. People buy these weekly.

## 6. An Email Course (Automated)

Write 5 to 7 emails that teach something step-by-step. Set them up in a free email tool (ConvertKit, MailerLite). Charge for access or use it as a lead magnet for a paid product.

The beauty: you write it once. It delivers itself forever. No live teaching. No scheduling. Pure automation.

## 7. A Resource List

Curate the best tools, apps, books, or services for a specific audience. "The 50 Best Free Tools for Freelance Designers." "Every Tax-Friendly Country for Digital Nomads, Ranked." Add brief reviews and your recommendation for each.

Curation has value because it saves people from drowning in options. You did the research. They pay for the shortcut.

## 8. A Tutorial or How-To PDF

Screen-by-screen instructions for something specific. "How to set up Google Analytics 4 for your Etsy shop." "How to create a professional invoice template in Google Docs." "How to automate your social media with Buffer."

Technical tutorials sell because they turn a frustrating 3-hour Google search into a 20-minute follow-along.

## 9. A Bundle

Take 3 to 5 of the items above and package them together. A "Freelancer Starter Kit" with a contract template, invoice template, project tracker, and client onboarding checklist. Bundles have higher perceived value and justify higher prices — $29 to $49 for items that might sell for $9 each.

The bundle strategy is how you go from "I sell a template" to "I sell a toolkit."

## 10. A Case Study or Breakdown

Document how you (or someone else) achieved a specific result. "How I went from 0 to 1,000 email subscribers in 90 days." "How I saved $12,000 on taxes by restructuring my business." Include the exact steps, tools, and timeline.

Case studies sell because they're proof wrapped in a roadmap. People buy the outcome, not the pages.

## The Common Thread

Every product on this list solves a specific problem, can be created with free tools, and takes hours — not months — to build. None of them require you to be an expert. You just need to be one step ahead of someone who's stuck.

The mechanics of choosing which one, validating the idea, [pricing it right](/blog/how-to-price-digital-products), writing a sales page that converts, and building an automated marketing system around it — that's the full playbook inside *Don't Do Anything*. But the starting line is here. Pick one. Build it this weekend. See what happens.
