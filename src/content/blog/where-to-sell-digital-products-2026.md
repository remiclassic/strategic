You've built the product. Now where do you put it?

This decision trips people up more than it should. They spend weeks comparing platforms instead of selling. Here's the shortcut: each platform has a specific strength. Match it to your situation and move on.

## Gumroad: The Creator's Default

**What it is:** A simple storefront for digital products. Upload your file, set a price, share a link. People buy. You get paid.

**Fees:** 10% flat fee on every sale. No monthly subscription. You pay nothing until you sell something.

**Strengths:** Dead simple. Beautiful checkout. Built-in email marketing. Affiliate program. Handles VAT for international sales. You can be live in 30 minutes.

**Weaknesses:** No built-in discovery. Nobody browses Gumroad looking for products. You bring the traffic. The 10% fee stings at scale — sell $10K/month and you're paying $1,000 in fees.

**Best for:** Creators who already have an audience (email list, social following, community) and want the simplest possible checkout. Great for getting started.

## Etsy: The Built-In Marketplace

**What it is:** A marketplace with 90+ million active buyers. Originally for handmade goods, now massive for digital products — templates, printables, planners, design assets.

**Fees:** $0.20 listing fee per item, 6.5% transaction fee, plus payment processing (~3%). Total: roughly 10-12% per sale. Plus optional advertising costs.

**Strengths:** Built-in traffic. People search Etsy for solutions. Your product can be discovered without you driving every visitor. SEO within the platform matters. Reviews build social proof.

**Weaknesses:** Competitive. Your product sits next to hundreds of similar ones. You're playing Etsy's algorithm game. Limited branding — your store looks like Etsy, not like you. Policy changes can tank your visibility overnight.

**Best for:** Printables, templates, and design assets. Anyone who wants organic discovery without building an audience first. Works especially well for visual products.

## Your Own Website: Full Control

**What it is:** Your domain, your design, your rules. Sell through payment processors like Stripe, Lemon Squeezy, or Paddle. Use a simple landing page builder or a full site.

**Fees:** Payment processing only — typically 2.9% + $0.30 per transaction. No platform cut. Some tools (Lemon Squeezy, Paddle) handle VAT and sales tax for a higher fee (~5%).

**Strengths:** You own the customer relationship. Full branding. No algorithm changes. You set the rules. Margins are the best of any option. You can build an email list, run retargeting ads, and create a real brand.

**Weaknesses:** No built-in traffic. You need to drive every visitor through SEO, social media, ads, or email. Setup takes more effort. You handle (or pay someone to handle) tax compliance unless using a merchant of record.

**Best for:** Anyone serious about building a brand and a business, not just selling a product. Long-term play. Best margins. Full ownership.

## The Other Contenders

**Payhip.** Similar to Gumroad. Free plan with 5% fee, paid plans with lower fees. Handles EU VAT. Good alternative if Gumroad's 10% feels steep.

**Teachable / Podia.** Better for courses and memberships than standalone digital products. Monthly fees. More features than you need if you're selling PDFs and templates.

**Creative Market.** Marketplace for design assets specifically. If you sell fonts, graphics, or UI kits, this is your Etsy equivalent.

**Amazon KDP.** For ebooks specifically. Massive reach. 30-70% royalty depending on pricing. You give up control and branding. Works as an additional channel, not your primary one.

## The Smart Strategy: Don't Pick One

The best approach isn't choosing a single platform. It's using each one for what it does best.

**Start on Gumroad or your own site** to validate the product. Get your first sales. Build an email list from buyers.

**List on Etsy** if your product fits the marketplace (templates, printables, planners). Let Etsy's traffic find you while you focus on your own channels.

**Build your own site** as the long-term home. Drive traffic through [content marketing](/blog/how-to-make-money-selling-digital-products) and SEO. Keep the best margins. Own the relationship.

Three channels. One product. Each platform working a different angle.

## Don't Let the Decision Stop You

The platform matters less than the product. A great product on the wrong platform still sells. A bad product on the perfect platform still fails.

Pick one. List your product. Start selling. Optimize the channel strategy later. The complete system for building, launching, and scaling a digital product business — including platform strategy, marketing automation, and going from one product to a full catalog — is inside *Don't Do Anything*.
