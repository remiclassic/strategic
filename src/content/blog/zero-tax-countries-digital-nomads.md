You're earning six figures from your laptop. Clients are global. You haven't set foot in an office in years. So why are you still paying 35% to a government you barely interact with?

Because nobody told you there are other options. Legal ones.

Territorial and zero-tax jurisdictions exist. They're not loopholes. They're policy choices — countries that decided to attract capital and talent by not taxing foreign-sourced income. If your work is done online for clients abroad, you might qualify. Here are seven worth knowing.

## 1. United Arab Emirates

**System:** Zero income tax on personal income. No tax on salary, dividends, or capital gains for individuals.

**The benefit:** Dubai and Abu Dhabi have become hubs for digital entrepreneurs. You get a residency visa (often through a freezone company or remote work visa), and your worldwide income is tax-free. Banking is solid. Infrastructure is excellent. Time zone works for Europe and Asia.

**The caveat:** Cost of living is high. You need to actually establish residency — which means some presence, though requirements have relaxed. And "zero tax" doesn't mean zero compliance. You still file. You still have obligations.

**Best for:** High earners who want a base in a major hub with strong banking and no personal income tax.

## 2. Panama

**System:** Territorial taxation. Only Panamanian-sourced income is taxed. Foreign income — from clients abroad, investments overseas, digital products sold globally — is not.

**The benefit:** Friendly to remote workers. Reasonable cost of living. The Friendly Nations visa offers a path to residency for citizens of many countries. Panama uses the US dollar, so no currency risk for Americans. Stable. Established.

**The caveat:** Banking can be bureaucratic. You need to properly structure your income as foreign-sourced. Physical presence requirements exist for residency — though they're manageable.

**Best for:** Americans and others wanting territorial treatment without moving to the other side of the world.

## 3. Paraguay

**System:** Territorial. Foreign-sourced income is not taxed. Only income from Paraguayan sources hits the tax net.

**The benefit:** One of the most straightforward territorial systems. Low cost of living. Permanent residency is achievable. No wealth tax. No inheritance tax. And you can establish tax residency with minimal physical presence — some programs require as little as a few weeks per year.

**The caveat:** Banking isn't as smooth as Panama or UAE. Infrastructure varies. Due diligence on banks and structure matters. It's emerging — not polished.

**Best for:** Minimal-presence seekers who want territorial treatment and are okay with a less developed financial sector.

## 4. Georgia

**System:** Territorial for individuals. Foreign income is exempt. Local income taxed at a flat 20% (with a low threshold).

**The benefit:** Tbilisi has become a digital nomad magnet. One-year remote work visa. Low cost of living. Good food, decent internet, friendly to entrepreneurs. Residency is straightforward. No tax on your global digital income.

**The caveat:** Banking for non-residents has tightened. You'll need to establish proper residency to access the territorial benefit. Geopolitics in the region — worth monitoring.

**Best for:** Nomads who want a low-cost base in a culturally rich city with clear territorial rules.

## 5. Costa Rica

**System:** Territorial for individuals. Foreign-sourced income is exempt. Only Costa Rican income is taxed.

**The benefit:** Stable democracy. Good healthcare. Pura vida lifestyle. Pensionado and rentista programs offer residency paths. If your income comes from abroad — clients, investments, digital products — it stays out of the tax net.

**The caveat:** Residency processes can be slow. Bureaucracy exists. You need to structure correctly and document that your income is foreign-sourced.

**Best for:** Those who want territorial treatment plus a high quality of life in a stable Central American country.

## 6. Malaysia

**System:** Territorial for certain programs. The MM2H (Malaysia My Second Home) and similar schemes, combined with proper structure, can result in no tax on foreign income. Malaysia taxes Malaysian-sourced income; foreign income can be exempt if you're not conducting business in Malaysia.

**The benefit:** Low cost of living. Great food. Good infrastructure. English widely spoken. Penang and Kuala Lumpur are popular with digital entrepreneurs. Long-term visas available.

**The caveat:** Rules have shifted. MM2H requirements changed recently. You need current advice. Structure matters — "foreign income" has to be properly documented and sourced.

**Best for:** Asia-based nomads who want territorial treatment and a high quality of life without Singapore prices.

## 7. Cayman Islands

**System:** Zero income tax. No corporate tax. No capital gains tax. No withholding tax.

**The benefit:** The gold standard for zero-tax jurisdictions. Clean. Well-regulated. Banking is serious. If you're a high earner or have significant assets, Cayman is the benchmark. Residency is possible through various routes.

**The caveat:** Expensive. Not a place to "live" in the traditional sense for most people. More of an asset-holding and high-end residency play. Compliance is strict — they have a reputation to protect.

**Best for:** High net worth individuals and those structuring significant assets or business operations.

Many of these countries also offer [residency programs with minimal physical presence](/blog/legal-residency-abroad-without-moving) — so you can establish tax residency without fully relocating.

## Legal vs. Evasion

Let's be clear: we're talking about legal tax positioning. Choosing a jurisdiction that doesn't tax your type of income is not evasion. It's the same thing corporations do when they incorporate in Delaware or Ireland. You're allowed to structure your affairs within the law.

Evasion is hiding income, lying about residency, or fabricating structures. Don't do that. The countries above have real rules. You need to meet them. Document everything. Get proper advice.

The detailed residency setup processes — which program to use, how to document foreign income, banking setup, compliance calendars — those live in the books. But the map is here. Seven countries. Seven paths. Your move.
