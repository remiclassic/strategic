You need to receive payments from clients in three currencies, pay contractors in two more, and keep your operating expenses separate from savings. Your local bank wants to charge you $40 per international wire and takes three days. Welcome to the fintech era.

Wise, Revolut, and Payoneer are the three platforms digital entrepreneurs use most. Each has a specific strength. None of them is best at everything. Here's the comparison that actually helps you choose.

## Wise Business (Formerly TransferWise)

**What it is:** A multi-currency account built for international money movement. Hold money in 40+ currencies. Receive like a local in 10+ countries (US, UK, EU, Australia, etc.). Convert at the mid-market rate — no markup. Send money to 70+ countries.

**Fees:**
- Account: Free to open
- Monthly fee: None
- Currency conversion: 0.33-0.67% (varies by currency pair)
- Receiving: Free for most currencies
- Sending: Small fee per transfer (usually $0.50-$2 for domestic, more for exotic currencies)

**Strengths:** The best exchange rates in fintech. Period. Wise uses the mid-market rate with a transparent, small fee. For businesses sending and receiving in multiple currencies, this saves hundreds or thousands per year compared to banks or competitors. Local account details in major markets mean your clients pay you as if you're in their country.

**Weaknesses:** Not a bank. Wise holds your money in regulated accounts, but it's not backed by deposit insurance in most jurisdictions. For daily operations and flow, it's excellent. For storing large amounts long-term, you want a proper bank. Also, Wise has become stricter about compliance — some business types (crypto, gambling, adult) get rejected or restricted.

**Best for:** The operational layer. Receiving client payments, paying contractors, converting currencies. The best option for most digital businesses as their primary day-to-day platform.

## Revolut Business

**What it is:** A broader fintech platform offering business accounts, corporate cards, expense management, budgeting tools, and multi-currency accounts. Think of it as a business bank replacement — with the caveat that it isn't actually a bank in most countries.

**Fees:**
- Free plan: Available (limited features)
- Grow plan: ~$25/month (most common for solopreneurs)
- Scale plan: ~$100/month (for teams)
- Currency conversion: Free up to a monthly limit (plan-dependent), then 0.4-1%
- ATM withdrawals: Free up to a limit, then 2%

**Strengths:** Feature-rich. Corporate cards, team expense management, budgeting categories, analytics. If you want something that feels like a complete business bank, Revolut comes closest. The app is polished. Crypto and stock trading are available (though whether you should use them through your business account is another question).

**Weaknesses:** Free currency conversion has limits — exceed them and the fees jump. The free plan is restrictive. Customer support is notoriously inconsistent — fast when it works, infuriating when it doesn't. Account freezes for compliance reviews happen more often than competitors. Regulatory status varies by country — it's a bank in Lithuania, but not everywhere.

**Best for:** Businesses that want an all-in-one platform with cards and expense management. Teams that need multiple cards and spending controls. European businesses (strongest regulatory position and features in EU/UK).

## Payoneer

**What it is:** A payment platform built for cross-border commerce. Originally designed for marketplace sellers (Amazon, Fiverr, Upwork), now used broadly by freelancers and international businesses. Receive in USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, and more. Transfer to local bank accounts globally.

**Fees:**
- Account: Free to open
- Monthly fee: None (but $29.95 annual fee if account is inactive)
- Receiving from marketplaces: Free
- Receiving via payment request: 1%
- Currency conversion: 0.5-2% (varies, less transparent than Wise)
- Withdrawal to bank: $1.50

**Strengths:** Marketplace integration. If you sell on Amazon, Upwork, Fiverr, or similar platforms, Payoneer is built for you. Direct integration means fast payouts. Multi-currency receiving accounts. The platform handles high volumes without blinking. Available in 200+ countries.

**Weaknesses:** More expensive than Wise for general business use. Currency conversion fees are less transparent — they're baked into the exchange rate rather than shown as a separate fee. The interface is functional but not modern. For businesses that don't use marketplaces, Payoneer offers less value than Wise or Revolut.

**Best for:** Marketplace sellers. Freelancers receiving payments from platforms. Businesses in countries where Wise and Revolut aren't available. People who need payment receiving in underserved markets.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

| Feature | Wise | Revolut | Payoneer |
|---------|------|---------|----------|
| **Best FX rates** | ✅ Winner | Good (with limits) | Weakest |
| **Business cards** | ❌ Limited | ✅ Winner | ✅ Available |
| **Marketplace integration** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Winner |
| **Expense management** | Basic | ✅ Winner | Basic |
| **Multi-currency accounts** | ✅ 40+ | ✅ 30+ | ✅ 5-6 |
| **Transparency** | ✅ Winner | Good | Weakest |
| **Customer support** | Good | Inconsistent | Good |
| **Country availability** | 60+ | 35+ | 200+ |

## The Smart Stack: Use More Than One

Don't pick one. Use each for its strength.

**Wise** for day-to-day operations: receiving payments, converting currencies, paying contractors. The best rates and transparency for the operational layer.

**Revolut** if you need cards and expense tracking. Useful for team expenses or when you want a card that works internationally without FX fees (up to plan limits).

**Payoneer** if you receive from marketplaces or need coverage in countries the others don't serve.

This layered approach is exactly the dual-layer strategy covered in *Global Banking Systems for Entrepreneurs* — fintech for operations, traditional banks for wealth storage. These three platforms handle the operations layer. For the wealth storage layer — [offshore banking, Swiss accounts, and high-net-worth solutions](/blog/offshore-banking-for-beginners) — that's a different conversation.

## What Fintech Can't Replace

All three platforms share a limitation: they're not traditional banks. Deposit insurance varies. Account freezes for compliance happen. Terms can change. For daily operations and money movement, they're superior to banks. For storing six figures long-term, you want a proper banking relationship in a stable jurisdiction.
