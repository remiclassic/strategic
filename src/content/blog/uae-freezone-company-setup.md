The UAE pitch is compelling: zero personal income tax, zero corporate tax in freezones, world-class banking, and a time zone that bridges Europe and Asia. It's why thousands of digital entrepreneurs have set up companies there in the last five years.

But "set up a freezone company" is the oversimplified version. The reality involves choices between dozens of freezones, varying costs, substance requirements that didn't exist five years ago, and a banking process that tests your patience. Here's the honest breakdown.

## What a Freezone Company Is

A freezone is a designated economic zone within the UAE that offers special business regulations. Companies registered in freezones get benefits — primarily zero corporate tax and 100% foreign ownership — in exchange for operating within the freezone's framework.

There are over 40 freezones across the UAE. Each has different rules, costs, and focus areas. DMCC (Dubai Multi Commodities Centre), RAKEZ (Ras Al Khaimah), IFZA (International Free Zone Authority), Ajman Free Zone, DIFC (Dubai International Financial Centre) — the alphabet soup is real.

The key distinction: freezone companies can trade internationally and with other freezone entities, but trading directly with the UAE mainland market requires a local partner or a dual license. For most digital businesses selling to global clients, this restriction doesn't matter.

## The Tax Reality (Post-2023)

The UAE introduced a 9% federal corporate tax in June 2023. This changed the game — but not as dramatically as headlines suggested.

**Freezone companies** can still qualify for a 0% rate on "qualifying income" — primarily income from transactions with entities outside the UAE or with other freezone entities. If your digital business serves international clients, you likely still pay 0%.

**The catch:** "qualifying" has conditions. You need to meet substance requirements, maintain adequate resources, and derive income from qualifying activities. Pure shell companies with no real activity don't qualify anymore.

**Personal income tax:** Still zero. No tax on salary, dividends, or capital gains for individuals. This is the part that hasn't changed and likely won't.

## Costs: The Real Numbers

Setup costs vary dramatically by freezone. Here's the range:

**Budget freezones (RAKEZ, Ajman, IFZA):**
- License: $2,000-$5,000/year
- Visa (1-2): $1,500-$3,000
- Total first year: $4,000-$8,000

**Mid-tier freezones (DMCC, Dubai Silicon Oasis):**
- License: $5,000-$10,000/year
- Visa (1-3): $2,000-$5,000
- Office/desk (if required): $3,000-$8,000/year
- Total first year: $10,000-$20,000

**Premium (DIFC, ADGM):**
- $15,000-$30,000+ first year
- These are regulated financial zones — overkill for most digital businesses

**Annual renewal:** Roughly 60-80% of your first-year cost. The license, visa, and address need annual renewal. This is the ongoing commitment most people underestimate.

## The Setup Process

**Step 1: Choose your freezone.** Based on your activity type, budget, visa needs, and whether you need a physical office. Most digital businesses do fine with RAKEZ or IFZA on the budget end, DMCC for credibility.

**Step 2: Apply for the license.** Submit your application, passport copies, business plan (sometimes), and proof of address. Processing: 1-3 weeks typically.

**Step 3: Get your visa.** Your company sponsors your UAE residency visa. This requires a medical test and Emirates ID — which means you need to visit the UAE in person. Processing: 2-4 weeks after arrival.

**Step 4: Open a bank account.** This is the hardest step. Banks require in-person visits, extensive documentation, and often reject applications or take months to process. More on this below.

**Total timeline:** 4-8 weeks from application to fully operational, assuming banking goes smoothly (it often doesn't).

## The Banking Headache

UAE banking is excellent once you're in. Getting in is the challenge.

Banks want to see: your license, visa, proof of business activity, client contracts, bank statements from other accounts, source of funds documentation, and sometimes a business plan. They'll ask about your expected transaction volumes and reject you if the numbers seem wrong for your profile.

**What works:** Having a clear, documentable business. Real clients. Real invoices. A coherent story about why you need UAE banking. Going through your freezone's recommended banking partner.

**What doesn't work:** Walking into a bank cold with a fresh license and no transaction history. Opening an account "just to have one."

The workaround: start with fintech. Wise Business and similar platforms work with UAE entities. Use them for initial operations while you build the history that traditional banks want to see.

## Substance Requirements

The days of a "brass plate" UAE company are over. To maintain your 0% freezone tax rate, you need:

- Adequate staff or outsourced resources in the UAE
- Core income-generating activities directed from the UAE
- A physical presence (even a flexi-desk counts for most freezones)

This doesn't mean you need to live in Dubai full-time. But you need to demonstrate that the company has real operations, not just a mailbox. Annual visits, documented management decisions, and proper record-keeping matter.

## Who Should Set Up in the UAE

**High earners ($100K+/year)** where the zero personal income tax saves more than the setup and maintenance costs.

**Businesses with Middle East or Asian clients** where a Dubai entity adds credibility and simplifies payments.

**Entrepreneurs willing to maintain some UAE presence** — even if it's quarterly visits. The substance requirements are real.

**People pairing UAE residency with a [territorial or zero-tax personal strategy](/blog/zero-tax-countries-digital-nomads).** UAE residency + UAE company + zero personal income tax is one of the cleanest structures available.

## Who Should Look Elsewhere

**Low-revenue businesses.** If you're making under $50K/year, the $5K-$10K+ annual cost doesn't make sense. A [Wyoming LLC](/blog/best-countries-incorporate-online-business) or Estonian company is more efficient at that scale.

**People who won't visit.** The visa process requires at least one trip. Ongoing substance requirements mean you should plan to visit. If you never plan to set foot in the UAE, it's the wrong structure.
