Estonia's e-Residency program sounds like a dream. A digital identity card. An EU company you can manage from your laptop. Zero tax on retained earnings. All for about €100.

The marketing is slick. The reality is more nuanced. Here's what the program actually delivers, where it falls short, and who it's genuinely good for.

## What e-Residency Actually Is

e-Residency is a digital identity issued by the Estonian government. It lets you start and manage an Estonian company online, sign documents digitally, and access Estonian business services remotely.

What it is not: residency. You don't get to live in Estonia. You don't get a visa. You don't become a tax resident. It's a business tool, not an immigration program. The name is misleading and they know it.

## The Tax Situation (Honest Version)

The headline: 0% corporate tax on retained earnings. Only pay tax when you distribute profits.

The fine print: this only helps if you're reinvesting profits into the business. The moment you pay yourself (salary, dividends, distributions), tax kicks in. Salary is taxed. Dividends face a 20% corporate income tax at the distribution level (effectively 20/80 = 25% on the net amount).

And here's the part nobody mentions in the blog posts: you're still personally taxed wherever you're a tax resident. If you live in Germany and pay yourself from an Estonian company, Germany taxes that income. Estonia's corporate structure doesn't eliminate your personal tax obligation in your home country.

The 0% retained earnings benefit is real, for businesses that genuinely reinvest profits. SaaS companies scaling their product. E-commerce businesses reinvesting in inventory. Tech companies funding development. If you're a solopreneur who needs to take money out to live, the benefit is smaller than advertised.

## The Banking Problem

This is where the dream meets reality. Estonian banks (particularly LHV, the main bank for e-Residency companies) have significantly tightened requirements. Many e-Residents report rejections, long wait times, and accounts closed without clear explanation.

The workaround: use payment processors and fintech instead. Wise Business, Payoneer, and similar platforms work with Estonian companies. But that means your "EU bank account" is actually a Wise account. Which is fine, but it's not what most people envision.

For businesses with high transaction volumes, EU clients, or regulatory requirements that need a real IBAN from a licensed bank, this bottleneck matters. It's the single biggest practical issue with e-Residency.

## The Real Costs

**Setup:**
- e-Residency application: ~€100-120
- Company incorporation (through service provider): €200-500
- Registered address: €30-60/month
- Accounting (mandatory): €50-150/month depending on complexity

**Ongoing annual cost:** €1,200-$3,000+ for a simple company with basic transactions. That's before tax on distributions.

It's not expensive compared to [UAE freezone companies](/blog/uae-freezone-company-setup) or Singapore entities. But it's not "€100 and you're done" either. The recurring accounting cost is the part that surprises people.

## Who It's Actually Good For

**SaaS and tech companies** that reinvest profits and want EU credibility. The 0% retained earnings policy is genuinely valuable here.

**EU-focused service businesses** that need to invoice European clients from an EU entity. An Estonian OÜ (private limited company) looks professional and handles EU compliance.

**Digital nomads who don't need banking.** If you're comfortable with Wise/Payoneer and don't need a traditional bank account, the system works smoothly.

**Location-independent entrepreneurs** paired with a [territorial tax residency](/blog/zero-tax-countries-digital-nomads). Estonian company + tax residency in a zero-tax or territorial country = potentially very efficient. But the residency piece is separate from e-Residency.

## Who Should Look Elsewhere

**Anyone expecting a tax haven.** Estonia isn't one. It's a tax deferral structure. Your personal tax depends on where you live.

**Anyone who needs reliable traditional banking.** The banking situation has been the program's Achilles heel for years.

**Very small businesses.** If you're making $2K/month selling PDFs, the ongoing accounting costs eat into your margins. A simpler structure ([Wyoming LLC](/blog/best-countries-incorporate-online-business), sole proprietorship, or local entity) might serve you better until revenue justifies the overhead.

## The Verdict

Estonia e-Residency is a solid tool for the right situation. EU credibility, digital-first management, tax deferral on reinvested profits. But it's not the frictionless "run a company from anywhere" experience the marketing implies.
